Synchronize Emacs colors with the current [[https://omarchy.org][Omarchy]] theme. When the active [[https://omarchy.org][Omarchy]]
theme changes [[https://github.com/mdoza/omarchy-sync][omarchy-sync]] detects the change and applies the colors changes.

** Installation

It is recommended to clone the [[https://github.com/mdoza/omarchy-sync][omarchy-sync]] repository into a location such as
~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/ and load using use-package:

#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package omarchy-sync
    :load-path "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/omarchy-sync/"
    :config
    (omarchy-sync/init))
#+end_src
